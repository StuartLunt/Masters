# Masters simulation and analysis
This repository contains the models and code that were used in the writing of my masters dissertation. MATLAB and Simulink R2021 were used. The Simscape Two Phase Fluid library is also required.

Exported simulation data can be found in a Dropbox folder [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wx9lmv2c9tqxfds/AACrDWiiv34Rszj1TqGTCRqMa?dl=0).
